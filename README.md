# Focus time Mobile application for both Android and iOs

the intension of making this application is to solve a problem of somthing that you may not have realized yet , but most people phase this problem . So here is the problem statement . have you ever does anything faster by setting a timer .Yes You have that is it same thing is happning here i this application ,
      you simply wrtie the task click on enter button, it takes you to another screen where you are able to see the timer, start/pause and other add time buttons. After the focus is compeleted the task is getting stored and marked as focused.
